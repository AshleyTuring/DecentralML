# DecentralML
A Polkadot protocol for decentralised federated machine learning and collective safety consensus

### Overview

One-liner: A Polkadot protocol for decentralised federated machine learning and collective safety consensus.

Project Description:
DecentralML introduces decentralised federated machine learning (DFML), governed by collective consensus to the Polkadot ecosystem. Our goal is to provide a robust framework for AI model developers, organisations, and applications, enabling decentralised ownership of models while ensuring privacy and scalability. With node or on-device training protecting privacy, the ability to share data training between organisations (nodes), collaborative AI training, and "collective" governance controls, DecentralML may transform the field of machine learning for state-of-the-art AI models (think LLMs and more) with transparent governance.

Integration with Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama:
DecentralML is built upon the Substrate framework, and leverages Tensorflow's extenisve Federated Machine Learning library enabling seamless integration into the Polkadot ecosystem. By leveraging Substrate's flexible and modular pallet architecture, we can shortcut a lot of the overhead needed to create a chain that has a dynamic "collective" consensus governance approach for things like AI model weights and other safety measures along with higher level controls for licensing of the entire models, jurisdiction training rules and other multi-territorial controls.  

The project aims to be as open and flexible as possible to integrate with other project with an innovative "bring your own" (BYO) token staking economy (faciliated by Pallets such as Balances, Grandpa, Ink! etc). 

We hope for active engagement from the wider Polkadot ecosystem and developer network once the project is complete or even during its development. We strongly believe that this project holds the transformative power to revolutionise the entire AI industry!

Team Motivation:
Our team is driven by the urgent need to challenge the dominance of centralised corporates like Facebook, OpenAI, Microsoft etc in the field of AI model development. These companies have built powerful models that require significant compute power and data, are not environmentally efficient, limit access to AI capabilities and, potentially, create a safety threat to humankind. We believe that these models could, not only be statistically improved if they were decentralised, but also may improve power usage efficiency and reduce saftey concerns by being transparently controlled by humankind on-chain, rather than a select number of corporations.

Our second motivation as Livetree, involves a solution for our AI tasks such as video processing: speech-to-text, facial recognition, scene detection and content recommendations. We currently solve these challenges using centralised model solutions and would like to make them more transparent. For further demonstrations or information on Livetree, feel free to download the free Livetree app and try speech-to-text or contact us. We will gladly provide instructions on how you can try the AI models within our our app and provide the raw AI JSON processing results for object detection, landmark recognition, speech-to-text and other AI processor outputs.

We are passionate about decentralisation and see the limitations of centralisation in terms of quality of the models, data ownership, privacy, and safety control. This has fueled our motivation to decentralise these models and create a decentralised federated machine learning substrate:
