# Federated learning

Federated learning is a method for composing models in federated manner. Each node (i.e. model contributor) participate to a portion of the training. A master node (i.e. model creator) then produce a single model by federating the results of the node.

In this example, a script for each role is provided.

## Model creator

The model creator generates a recognition model. This model is added as asset of the DecentralML structure.
This model is then used by the model contributor for their portion of the training.

Once the model contributors have performed the local training on the portion of dataset assigned to them, the model creator can fetch the results as assets, and generate a federate model averaging the model generated by the contributors (Different policies could be used to federate the contributors' models.).

## Model contributor

The model contributor script is built to: i) fetch the model generated by the model creator, ii) locally train such model on the dataset (or portion of dataset) provided by the model creator, iii) upload the newly trained model as asset of the DecentralML structure.
